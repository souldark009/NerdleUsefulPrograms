# NerdleUsefulPrograms
Repository for little useful programs for the game nerdle (https://nerdlegame.com)

The main language is italian and the code needs a lot of refactoring and commenting, it will be uploaded when i feel that a particular situation in Nerdle needs coding because is not fun. (Like knowing most of the numbers but you need to permutate all the answers)
